## 🎯 Development Methodology

### Agile Development Framework
We follow a **hybrid Agile approach** combining Scrum methodology with Kanban flow management for maximum flexibility and efficiency.

### Core Principles
- **Iterative Development**: 2-week sprints with continuous feedback
- **Module-First Approach**: Develop each module independently 
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Documentation-First**: Comprehensive documentation for all features

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kongrepad/portal.kongrepad.com.git
cd portal.kongrepad.com

# 2. Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# 3. Environment setup
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# 4. Database setup
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# 5. Development server
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```
